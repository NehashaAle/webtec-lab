    <h1>The Mysterious Forest</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, in a <strong>dense and dark forest</strong>, there lived a curious little fox named <em>Rusty</em>.</p>

    <h2>The Discovery</h2>
    <p>One day, while exploring, Rusty found a <mark>strange, glowing stone</mark> hidden under a bush. It was <small>small but radiant</small>, and it seemed to hum with energy.</p>

    <h3>The Ancient Legend</h3>
    <p>Rusty remembered an old tale his grandmother had told him about a <del>cursed gem</del> <ins>magical artifact</ins> that could grant wishes. <span style="color: blue;">Could this be it?</span></p>

    <h4>The Decision</h4>
    <p>Rusty decided to take the stone to the <u>wise old owl</u> who lived deep in the forest. The owl was known for his knowledge of ancient mysteries.</p>

    <h5>The Journey</h5>
    <p>As Rusty traveled, he noticed the forest seemed <b>quieter than usual</b>. The birds had stopped chirping, and the wind had stilled. It was as if the forest was holding its breath.</p>

    <h6>The Encounter</h6>
    <p>Finally, Rusty reached the owl's tree. The owl looked at the stone and said, <pre>"This is no ordinary stone. It is the <sup>Heart</sup> of the Forest, and it has chosen you."</pre></p>

    <p>Rusty was amazed. He realized he had a great responsibility to protect the forest and its secrets. From that day on, he became the <sub>guardian</sub> of the Heart of the Forest.</p>

    <p>And so, the forest thrived, and Rusty's story became a legend, passed down through generations.</p>
